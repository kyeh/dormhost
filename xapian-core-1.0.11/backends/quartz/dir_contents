<Description>
This backend uses a custom written Btree management system to store
posting lists and termlists.  This is a reasonably efficient
backend, using compression to store the postlists.  Positional
information and transactions are both supported.  Quartz is
was the default backend prior to Xapian 1.0.  Its use is
deprecated for new systems and it will eventually be retired.
