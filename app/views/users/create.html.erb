      <p>
        An email has been sent to <%= @user.email %> with instructions to activate 
        your account.
        <li>
          If your email is not valid, you must <%= link_to "sign up", signup_path %> 
          again and provide a valid email address.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you don't receive an email, check your bulk or trash folder, as your spam 
          filter may have inadvertantly caught the registration email.
        </li>
